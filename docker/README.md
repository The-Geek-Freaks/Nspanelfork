# NSPanel Manager
This is a software solution for managing and using the Sonoff NSPanel. The project aims to be easy and intuitive to use, both during setup and daily use. The software consists of three parts:
* The management container (can be installed as a Home Assistant addon or standalone docker container).
* The firmware for the NSPanel. This has to be flashed manually. See https://nspanelmanager.com or https://github.com/tpanajott/NSPanelManager
* The TFT file for the GUI. This can be flashed with the panel on the wall via a simple push of a button in the manager UI.
